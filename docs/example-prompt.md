Please DO NOT attempt to read articles that are behind paywalls. Split your time evenly between news sites, and work quickly.

Output a list of all the news post links from the past seven days for all of the sites, the news post titles, and the date that they were published. Use markdown link formatting, and group posts by their source website.

Finally, write a brief Slack message summary of the top ten news items that you consider most important, please use markdown with the links so I can copy and paste them into Slack directly.
